# PlayStore

## Programming Fundamentals Assignment 2

#### Assignment Overview

A PlayStore is a standalone digital marketplace that allows users to browse and download
mobile applications (APPs). The PlayStore also serves as a digital store offering publications
like e-books and digital magazines. Applications and publication items in the PlayStore are
either free or can be bought for a price.
The program you create will allow the creation of a store, filling it with products, creating users
and simulating their interaction with the store (purchasing products, adding comments etc). 

#### Assessment Tasks

Your program should consist of multiple class files where you can demonstrate your knowledge
of inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, abstract classes, etc. You need to write
classes, add methods and variables to complete the following tasks performed by the admin of
the PlayStore.

*There are two sample/starter classes (PlayStoreMain.java and PlayStore.java) provided.*

#### Objective

The main objective of this assignment is to familiarize you with object oriented design and
programming. Object oriented programming helps to solve complex problems by coming up with
a number of domain classes and associations. However identifying meaningful classes and
interactions requires a fair amount of design experience. Such experience cannot be gained by
classroom-based teaching alone but must be gained through project experience.
This assignment is designed to introduce different concepts such as inheritance, abstract
classes, method overloading, method overriding, and polymorphism.
